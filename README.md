# EndSentiEnd

__Sentiment Analysis__ is the NLP task focused on the computational treatment
of opinions, sentiment and subjectivity in text [[1]](#ref_pang_lee_2008). The study 
of the sentiment of an utterance (text or speech) is not a trivial task and it
goes beyond the identification of the number of positive and negative words in the text.

The aim of this project is the development of a classification system for the
task of fine grained sentiment analysis, in other words Aspect Based Sentiment
Analysis (ABSA). The final system must recognise entities, aspects, attributes and
classify the opinion's sentiment about them in the input utterance.

The development will be incrementally and it will start with a base system for
the identification of aspects and several modules will be added in order to
reach all the requirements.

This repository contains experimental software, so you should not use it in a
production environment. Moreover, the authors of the code are not responsible
of the issues that can cause the run of the code.
